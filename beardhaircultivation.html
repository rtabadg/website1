    <h1>Cultivating microbes from my beard hair</h1>

<body>A few years ago my ex-fiance (who is now my wife) 
bought me a beer called "Ryan" which
 was allegedly fermented with yeast fermented 
 with the brewer Ryan's beard hair. While somewhat gross, 
 I recently got some falcon tubes and DME and thought it 
 would be a fun experiment to try. Worst that happens is my basement smells
 a little weird(er) for a couple weeks.
 <br><br>
 I used enough pilsner DME to make 400mL of 1.040 wort, then divided that into 6 50 mL falcon tubes with about 100 mL of extra wort that I dumped.
 Two of the 50 mL got yeast slurry from my <a href="3711/3724 Biere de garde hybrid.html">3711/3724 Beire de garde hybrid</a>, 2 falcon tubes
 got slurry from my <a href="Hoppy saison 1.html">Hoppy saison #1 recipe</a>, 1 got one of my beard hairs with a tsp of vodka, and 
 1 got a dandelion pedal from my yard with 1 tsp of vodka. The vodka was added to try to ward off any nasty bacteria or yeast that 
 can't handle a little bit of grandpa's favorite cough medicine.
 <br><br>
 
 <u>04/30/2024</u>
 <br>
 The 4 falcon tubes with harvested dregs took off within a day unsurprisingly, with the beard hair and 
 dandelion cultures taking about 5 days to see any signs of fermentation. 
 
 <br><br>
 Smells: The beard hair sample smells like nail polish remover and overly ripe fruit. Pretty common
 for wild fermentations, but nothing unpleasant which I'm pretty happy about.
 <br>
 Dandelion sample shows less fermentation signs, but smells like pears. Very pleasant.
